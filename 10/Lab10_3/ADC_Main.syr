The following registers are absorbed into counter <count>: 1 register on signal <count>.
INFO:Xst:3231 - The small RAM <Mram_dig0[3]_PWR_1_o_wide_mux_27_OUT> will be implemented on LUTs in order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint ram_style.
